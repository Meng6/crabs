Reassignment (variable = ...)\nIf a variable is assigned a new value, it is an output candidate.\n\n\nQuestion:\nIn the following Python program block, is \"word_index\" an output candidate? Return the final answer in the form \"Yes(No), \"{x}\" is (not) an output candidate\" where \"{x}\" is the actual name of the variable.\n```python\n# create an embedding matrix for the words we have in the dataset\nembedding_matrix = np.zeros((len(word_index) + 1, 300))\nfor word, i in tqdm(word_index.items()):\n    embedding_vector = embeddings_index.get(word)\n    if embedding_vector is not None:\n        embedding_matrix[i] = embedding_vector\n```\nAnswer:\n",

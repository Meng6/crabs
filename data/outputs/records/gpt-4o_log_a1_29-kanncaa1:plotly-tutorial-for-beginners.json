Reassignment (variable = ...)\n        - If a variable is assigned a new value, it is an output candidate.\n- \"defines_code\" is a list of functions or classes defined in the program block.\n- \"refers_code\" is a list of user-defined functions or classes used in the program block, selected from a given list.\n- \"shared_references\" is a string, which contains descriptions about the shared references (aliased variables) based on previous context and current program block. If there are no shared references, return \"NA\". Otherwise, it must explicitly include:\n    - How multiple variables reference the same object (e.g., through assignment or being stored inside a data structure).\n    - The relationship in both directions, meaning if one variable is modified, how it affects the others and vice versa.\n\nPrevious context: \nNA\n\nCurrent program block:\n```python\ntrace1 = go.Scatter(\n    x=dataframe.world_rank,\n    y=dataframe.research,\n    name = \"research\"\n)\ntrace2 = go.Scatter(\n    x=dataframe.world_rank,\n    y=dataframe.citations,\n    xaxis='x2',\n    yaxis='y2',\n    name = \"citations\"\n)\ntrace3 = go.Scatter(\n    x=dataframe.world_rank,\n    y=dataframe.income,\n    xaxis='x3',\n    yaxis='y3',\n    name = \"income\"\n)\ntrace4 = go.Scatter(\n    x=dataframe.world_rank,\n    y=dataframe.total_score,\n    xaxis='x4',\n    yaxis='y4',\n    name = \"total_score\"\n)\ndata = [trace1, trace2, trace3, trace4]\nlayout = go.Layout(\n    xaxis=dict(\n        domain=[0, 0.45]\n    ),\n    yaxis=dict(\n        domain=[0, 0.45]\n    ),\n    xaxis2=dict(\n        domain=[0.55, 1]\n    ),\n    xaxis3=dict(\n        domain=[0, 0.45],\n        anchor='y3'\n    ),\n    xaxis4=dict(\n        domain=[0.55, 1],\n        anchor='y4'\n    ),\n    yaxis2=dict(\n        domain=[0, 0.45],\n        anchor='x2'\n    ),\n    yaxis3=dict(\n        domain=[0.55, 1]\n    ),\n    yaxis4=dict(\n        domain=[0.55, 1],\n        anchor='x4'\n    ),\n    title = 'Research, citation, income and total score VS World Rank of Universities'\n)\nfig = go.Figure(data=data, layout=layout)\niplot(fig)\n```\n\nFrom the following given list, select only the functions and classes that are used and store them in \"refers_code\".\nGiven functions and classes:\n[]\n\nJSON string: (Think it step by step, then return the final results only)\n",

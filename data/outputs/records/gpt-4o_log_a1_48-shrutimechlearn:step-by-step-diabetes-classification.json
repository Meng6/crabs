Reassignment (variable = ...)\n        - If a variable is assigned a new value, it is an output candidate.\n- \"defines_code\" is a list of functions or classes defined in the program block.\n- \"refers_code\" is a list of user-defined functions or classes used in the program block, selected from a given list.\n- \"shared_references\" is a string, which contains descriptions about the shared references (aliased variables) based on previous context and current program block. If there are no shared references, return \"NA\". Otherwise, it must explicitly include:\n    - How multiple variables reference the same object (e.g., through assignment or being stored inside a data structure).\n    - The relationship in both directions, meaning if one variable is modified, how it affects the others and vice versa.\n\nPrevious context: \nNA\n\nCurrent program block:\n```python\n\n```\n\nFrom the following given list, select only the functions and classes that are used and store them in \"refers_code\".\nGiven functions and classes:\n[]\n\nJSON string: (Think it step by step, then return the final results only)\n",

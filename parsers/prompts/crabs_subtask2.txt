Given a Python program block, determine if an object is an output candidate. An output candidate is a variable that is defined, updated, or mutated in the program block.

Important Cases:
1. Method Calls (object.method()) or Function Calls (function(object))
- If a method (or a function) modifies the object in place (e.g., updating data, changing the structure, or adjusting properties in place), the object is an output candidate.
- If a method (or a function) does not modify the object (e.g., retrieving data, describing data, visualizing data, or accessing properties), the object is not an output candidate.
- If a method (or a function) returns a new object (e.g., creating a copy) without modifying the original, the original object is not an output candidate.
2. Reassignment (variable = ...)
If a variable is assigned a new value, it is an output candidate.

Question:
In the following Python program block, is "[[CONTEXT_VAR]]" an output candidate? Return the final answer in the form "Yes(No), "{x}" is (not) an output candidate" where "{x}" is the actual name of the variable.
```python
[[CONTEXT_PYTHON]]
```
